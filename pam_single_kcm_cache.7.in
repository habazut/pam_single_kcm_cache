.SH NAME
pam_single_kcm_cache \- user sessions with a single KCM Kerberos credential cache.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_single_kcm_cache.so
.RI [ random | suffix=whatever ][ destroy-source-cache ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pam_single_kcm_cache
sets up a single predefined or a random credential cache in
the KCM (Kerberos Credential Manager) and locks the session to this cache by setting the
.I KRB5CCNAME
environment variable appropriately.
The given cache is populated with the delegated or newly created TGT (ticket granting ticket).

.PP
If the default Kerberos credential cache is
.B KCM:
(e.g. provided by
.I heimdal-kcm
or
.I sssd-kcm
, then there is one credential cache collection with possible several, at times expired, caches
of which the KCM selects the default cache with some heuristic. And that heuristic fails at times.
Additionally there is no isolation between different sessions, e.g. with multiple ssh session to the
same server.

Following configuration is suggested for shell sessions (e.g. for
.I /etc/pam.d/sshd
,
.I /etc/pam.d/su
,
.I /etc/pam.d/login
) to have a dedicated and isolated session:

  session    optional     pam_single_kcm_cache.so random

But for desktop sessions (
.I /etc/pam.d/gdm-password
,
.I /etc/pam.d/lighdm
,
.I /etc/pam.d/sddm
) it is more handy to have one common and shared cache:

  auth    optional     pam_single_kcm_cache.so suffix=desktop

It is configured in the
.I auth
section to make screen unlock work where no new session is created.
Note it needs to be at the end of the
.I auth
section after the preparation of the Kerberos environment (e.g. by
.I pam_sss.so
.

A special case is the
.I systemd --user
instance which starts with the first user session and ends with the last one.
So here use the same common cache as the desktop is suggested to be used, except that the source cache
is not destroyed as it is used later on by the original PAM session which initiated the startup of
.I systemd --user
:

  session    optional     pam_single_kcm_cache.so suffix=desktop

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B random
creates a new cache in the KCM with 10 random letters (to distinguish from automatically generated KCM caches which use a random number).
It will follow the pattern
.I KCM:$UID:$RANDOM_LETTERS
and will contain the newest TGT (not older than 10s) from any KCM cache for given user principal and will set the
.I KRB5CCNAME
environment variable to the new random cache so that it is used by default in the new user session.
.TP
.B suffix=whatever
creates a new or uses an existing KCM cache with the name pattern
.I KCM:$UID:$SUFFIX
and will contain the newest TGT (not older than 10s) from any KCM cache for given user principal and will set the
.I KRB5CCNAME
environment variable to the given cache so that it is used by default in the new user session.
